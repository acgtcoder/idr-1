Simulated data
}
\description{
  This is a simulated dataset for testing the program. Data is first
  simulated from the copula mixture model with latent structure of 0.65
  N(mu, mu, sigma, sigma, rho) + 0.95 N(0, 0, 1, 1, 0), where mu=2.5,
  sigma=1, rho=0.84. The observations
  in the dataset are then generated by taking the p-values from a z-test H0:
  mu=0.

\usage{data(simu.idr)}
\format{
  A data frame with 1000 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{x}}{a numeric vector, representing p-values on replicate
    1}
    \item{\code{y}}{a numeric vector, representing p-values on replicate
    2}
    \item{\code{labels}}{a binary vector, where 1 represents the
      reproducible component and 0 represents the irreproducible component. }
